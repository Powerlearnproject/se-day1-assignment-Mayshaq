Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
a) software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintainance of high quality sotware systems.
b)software engineering plays a crucial role in the tech industry by enabling by allowing creation of software systems and applications that power various aspects of modern life including communication, commerce and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a) Development of programming languages e.g. Fortran, C
b) Establishment of software engineering as a disciplinein the 1960s.
c) Advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
d) Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a) Requirements-Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
b) Design-creating high quality and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
c) Implementation-writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
d) Testing-conducting various tests to ensure the software meets the quality standards and functional requirements.
e) Deployment-Release of the software to users or customers.
f) Maintainance-Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
a) Waterfall-sequential approach with distinct phases(e.g requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards in steps. Suitable for projects with concrete timelines and well-defined variables.
b) Agile-iteretative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change. Suited for projects where significant constraints are no well understood.if the project involves developing a new product, the scope and timeline may be difficult to evaluate in advance.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a) Software Developer-responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
b) Quality Assurance Engineer-ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
c) Project Manager-oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
a) These tools enhance productivity and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control, debugging tools,and automated testing capabilities.
b) Examples of IDEs- Visual studio, Eclipse, Intellij IDEA.
c) Examples of VCS- Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a) Challenging requirements-requirements may change during the development cycle leading to scope creep and project delays.
b) Tight deadlines-pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
c) Technical debt-accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions which can impede future development efforts and increase maintainance costs.
d) Strategies for overcoming- efective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a) Unit testing-testing individual components or modules of software.
b) Integrarion testing-testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
c) System testing-testing the entire software as a whole.
d) Acceptance testing-testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
a) Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
It is important as it improves the interaction between AI and humans.it helps AI understand a request better.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
a) 'Tell me about cars' is a vague prompt which will give general information on cars 
b) 'Tell me about the history of mercedes car' is an improved prompt which will is more effective as it specific and clear helping the AI understand what the user needs and provide the with the exact information.
